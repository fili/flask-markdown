A fork of [Flask-Markdown](https://github.com/brmullikin/flask-markdown) whose goal, ultimately, is to be merged back into the [original]((https://github.com/dcolish/flask-markdown)).

## Why a Fork of the original Flask-Markdown?

There are 4 reasons/goals for this fork.

1. The original Flask-Markdown was not responding to Issues or Pull Requests.
2. Ensure the repository conforms to pep8 & pep257 standards (prefering pep257 where they conflict), and to convert nose tests into pytest.
3. Conform to current Flask plugins standards.
4. Add in a few minor features.

## Why a Fork of a Fork?

1. To make this package installable using pip as flask-markdown 0.4 without having to refer to a git repo.
2. As the fork owner B. R. Mullikin has not updated the repo for the last 5 years and not responded to an open pull request for approx the last two years.
3. Incorporated open pull request in forker repo.
